# 3D Fish Animation
3D computer graphics project used OpenGL

- This project has ground box, redfish, 2 rocks and 3 seaweeds, each of them has 10 ellipses. 
- All seaweed strands are identical and moving in the same direction. 
- The fish which has 2 eyes with pupils, 1 head, 1 body and 2 tail fins, swims in a fashion that encircles seaweeds which are making sinusoidal movements. 
- To see my animation, please download all files and then run main.html file. Also note that all the other files should be in the same directory where you put main.html file.

Enjoy! :)
