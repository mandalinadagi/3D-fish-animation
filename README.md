# 3D_fish_animation
3D computer graphics project used OpenGL

This project has ground box, redfish, 2 rocks and 3 seaweeds, each of them has 10 ellipses. 
All seaweed strands are identical and moving in the same direction. 
My fish has 2 eyes with pupils, 1 head, 1 body and 2 tail fins. The fish swims in a circle contains seaweeds and also has sinusoidal movement. 
To see my animation, please run main.html file where all the other files should be downloaded and added in the same directory.

Enjoy! :)
